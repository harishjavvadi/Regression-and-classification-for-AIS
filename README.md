Introduction:
Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) casts a long shadow over millions of adolescents worldwide. Affecting 3% of this age group, it presents as a complex three-dimensional deformity of the spine. This deformity isn't limited to just a sideways curvature (lateral bending) – it also involves a twisting of the vertebrae (axial rotation) and disrupts the normal front-to-back alignment (sagittal abnormality). 

Currently, the battle against AIS is fought primarily through non-surgical interventions like exercise programs and bracing. While these approaches offer valuable management tools, recent studies are exploring the potential of combining these methods for even better results. However, a crucial missing piece remains – the ability to predict treatment outcomes early on. 

Imagine a world where doctors, armed with the power of prediction, can tailor treatment plans to each individual patient. This could revolutionize AIS management. By identifying patients likely to respond well to specific interventions, doctors could potentially achieve greater success rates while minimizing unnecessary procedures. 

This project takes a bold step towards this future by harnessing the power of machine learning. We aim to develop not just one, but at least three distinct prognostic models. These models will be trained on a rich dataset encompassing various factors that influence AIS. This data will include not only basic demographics like age and gender, but also crucial measurements of the spinal curvature itself, such as the Cobb angle. 

The first model will focus on predicting the final Cobb angle, a key indicator of long-term curve severity. This will empower doctors to understand the potential trajectory of the curvature and make informed decisions about treatment intensity. 

The second model delves deeper, aiming to predict curve progression itself. By accurately identifying patients at high risk for worsening curves, doctors can intervene early, potentially preventing the need for surgery and its associated risks. 

Developing these models holds immense promise. By unraveling the complex interplay of factors that influence AIS progression and treatment effectiveness, we can refine treatment protocols and ultimately improve patient outcomes for millions of adolescents living with this condition. This project is not just about creating models; it's about creating a future where early prediction empowers better treatment for AIS.
